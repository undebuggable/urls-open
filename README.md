urls-open
=============

Open a list of URLs in tabs of a selected internet browser.

Introduction
-------------

This utility aims to reliably open a list of URLs stored in a text file in separate tabs of a selected browser on Linux and MacOS platforms.

Currently supported web browsers:
- Chromium
- Google Chrome
- Firefox

The text file should contain each URL in a separate line. Lines starting with has character (`#`) are treated as a comment and ignored.

Example invocation of the utility:
`urls-open urls/urls-web-browsers.txt`
